    <h1>hello</h1>
    <p>i am one for making extremely convoluted ways to talking about my feelings for people without actually doing so, and this website is just another version of that.</p>
    <p>here you will find notes, journals and other various things that i remember too add here, see this as a way to look into a stranger's soul</p>
    <p>enjoy :)</p>
    <hr>
    <p>it will take me some time to get organized and some more time on top of that to get some css in here, i'm still debating between a long index or have each note be it's own page, although i feel if would be annoying to have to go back and forth for each note, and i don't know enouth javascript to make something expand or collapse, a shame.</p>
