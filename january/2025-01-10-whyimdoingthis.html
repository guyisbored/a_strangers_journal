    <p>why am i doing this</p>
    <p>what's the point</p>
    <p>who's gonna see it</p>
    <p>recently i've been thinking about new york and in going through my pictures i stumbled across something i had forgotten about.</p>
    <p>the strangers project, written notes by the people of nyc.</p>
    <p>unfortunately at the time i wasn't able to go inside, but i had often fantacized about going and writing something and reading other's struggles</p>
    <p>it feel like in our modern society we are being pushed away more and more, we've learned to hate each other, criticize each other, judge each other over trivial things.</p>
    <p>i am terrified of living in a world like that... i'm scared to be who i am but i feel like i can't talk about it to anyone cause i'll just get judged. i'm not in a position to run away, but i wish i did. so many times in my life i regret not running away, even if i died in the cold maybe i would have been able to finally get through.</p>
    <p>the people around me are so dismissive of who i am or others like me, and i can't do anything for myself until i can escape from these people.</p>
    <p>if it feels like i'm being vague, i am. i'm terrified of myself, it's horrible. i feel like i'm never going to be comfortable in this body and i'll only find escape in certain death. if anyone around me caught on to who i really am... i fear it would ruin my life.</p>
