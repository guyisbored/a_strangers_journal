    <p>maybe it's time i just accept who i am</p>
    <p>i've been unsure of myself for so long</p>
    <p>but there's one thing i am sure of</p>
    <p>i'm miserable being myself</p>
    <p>i feel like, just by staying how i am, i'm being dishonest to everyone around me, they're meeting someone else, a character whom i hate playing</p>
    <p>i'm lying to myself</p>
    <p>this isn't who i am and i know it</p>
    <p>but i'm too scared to do anything</p>
    <p>there are pleanty of little moments in my life that i think of often, one of which is an old note that will problably be added to misc later, (maybe if i remember, i'll link it here when i put it on the website, although problably not) so i'll talk about the other one</p>
    <img src="">
    <p>(i can't log in to get the image at the moment, but hopefully i remember to do it later)</p>
    <p>on vacation when we stayed at an aunt's place for a little while, she had a cat (who's name i am unfortunately blanking on).</p>
    <p>during this period i was still questioning myself and my identity, but i was doing very little about it</p>
    <p>her cat apparently only takes well to girls, and when any man came by, including my aunt's son, she would go and hide.</p>
    <p>but when i had come to the house, the cat had taken an instant liking to me, one that my aunt said she hadn't seen before</p>
    <p>i felt seen, a feeling i've only had a few times before and would have even less times after.</p>
    <p>talking about it now feels silly, but maybe that's just cause of how late i'm writing this.</p>
    <p>i don't think this one should go public, but i'm problably going to upload it anyways</p>
    <p>i kinda fucked this one up</p>
    <p>hopefully i rewrite it later and you're not just left with this poor excuse of a story</p>
    <p>maybe i'll come back and make it more interesting, or tie it to some other event, or maybe i'll quote that note i talked about earlier</p>
    <p>so much possibility... so much that won't get done...</p>
