<body>
    <p>i often fantacize about running away</p>
    <p>i don't think i'll be able to progress on any of my problems until i leave my family, they're already so unsuportive of me, and i know that things would only get worse</p>
    <p>but i would honestly throw it all away if it meant i had a chance at being happy</p>
    <p>i would give it all up if it meant i could be myself</p>
    <p>how much would you sacrifice for happiness?</p>
