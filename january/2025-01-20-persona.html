    <p>i lie to everyone i meet</p>
    <p>i've perfected a persona, i've made a identity made of lies and deceit</p>
    <p>how he acts, how he present himself, how he looks, how he dresses, is completely disconnected to who i really am</p>
    <p>all of it is built off of lies in order to seem more likeable, in order to survive</p>
    <p>the only real thing about him is his grandfather's name</p>
    <p>i've ruined many relationships by making him step aside</p>
    <p>people tend to perfer him more than they do me, and i don't blame them, he has character</p>
    <p>but i'm debating letting him go</p>
    <p>because well he's served me well and helped me get through high school</p>
    <p>i'm not in high school anymore</p>
    <p>and if i introduce people to him and then let him go, people will hate me</p>
    <p>but if i keep him i'll regret it</p>
    <p>i've outgrown him</p>
    <p>but i've also been dependant on him</p>
    <p>whatever i choose, i have to choose it fast</p>
    <p>i hope it goes well</p>
