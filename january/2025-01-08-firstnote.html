    <p>really this is just an excuse to keep my hands busy, and to see how much html and css i remember. So far i've had to cross reference most of my code with my other pages, but i do enjoy coding.</p>
    <p>i have absolutely no clue how github works, but if they'll host my page i'm willing to learn. i haven't been able to commit changes through vs code yet so i hope that things will work out.</p>
    <p>i've been on break for a while. i wanted to finish my story, but i always struggle to do things for myself. even when i'm on break, i feel like i'm being unproductive.</p>
    <p>i wonder how open i should be in these notes. i struggle to talk about anything real since this could be traced back to me, and a lot of my friends or colleagues don't know a lot of things about me. but at the same time i don't think they'd care enough to read these, no one would, so maybe it's not such a big deal. i'm really just singing to an empty crowd, it's not like this will take off or be shared somewhere, it's just for me.</p>
    <p>but what do i get out of this that i don't get out of a notes app? my ideas and lack of self-worth aren't worthy of being published or shown to the world. you could say that doing this could only cause harm. but i don't know.</p>
