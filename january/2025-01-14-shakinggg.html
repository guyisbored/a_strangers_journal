    <p>i'm shajing i'm racing i can't stop moving i'm pacing oh god why did i let her kiss me oh my god i should have never talked to her what was i thinking how could i let that happen i can't go on like this i have to call things off it's not fair why can't i stop shaking i can't have another panic attack</p>
    <p>that sound won't stop, a thumping within my chest with the consistency of a soldier's marching, every step another mistake, every stomp someone crushed, every thump someone falling</p>
    <p>maybe i deserve this, maybe whatever is happening to me is my fault</p>
    <p>things were supposed to be different</p>
    <p>things were supposed to be better</p>
    <p>is it too late to change?</p>
    <p>i'm afraid i already ruined everything before it could even start</p>
    <p>i'm afraid i'll never be able to live life in a way that i'm content with</p>
    <p>oh... forget all these stupid convoluted things</p>
    <p>i'll spare you the speech this time</p>
    <p>there's a million different ways i could say it</p>
    <p>and a million different problems i could isolate</p>
    <p>but there's no point in that</p>
    <p>when i could say it in one, simple, line</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>i'm scared</p>
