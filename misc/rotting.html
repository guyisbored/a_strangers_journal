        <p>for rotting heals all wounds</p>
        <p>all cuts all scars</p>
        <p>all ilness</p>
        <p>for the body that caused you pain will simply fade away</p>
        <p>the heart that once ached now lives to nurture the trees</p>
        <p>the brain that you desperately tried to fix now just dust in an empty room</p>
        <p>and you'll be seen, in part, in the flowers growing above</p>
        <p>bathed in the sun once more</p>
        <p>beautiful but</p>
        <p>rarely even admired by those who walk</p>
        <p>the only remaining trace of you</p>
        <p>to wither away again</p>
        <p>or be stepped on</p>
        <p>that is what you leave behind</p>
        <p>for your legacy will die, if it even got the chance to crawl in the first place</p>
        <p>and your memory will be swept away</p>
        <p>in the end, all you leave is a perfect skeleton</p>
